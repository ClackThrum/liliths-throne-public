		You find yourself going past a quaint village, standing out in the middle of the frosty mountainside. A shabby sign barely spells out "Nirth", and you can see a few figures moving about in the houses, getting ready for the day. As a refuge for the harsh winterland around it, Nirth seems like quite an appealing place, despite looking quite run down.
	</p>
	<p>
		Due to the fact that it's still quite early in the morning, the villagers don't take much notice of you; most of them are probably just going about their everyday business. The villagers seem to be comprised of mostly winterland types, with heavy fur and strong bodies.
	</p>
	<p>
		The village seems to be surrounded by a wooden fence, and upon entering through the only open gate, you see that the houses are all made of wood as well.
